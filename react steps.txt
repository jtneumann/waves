create-react-app my-app
log->
C:\Users\cusha\my-react-app>create-react-app my-app
'create-react-app' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
I am not able to start the next step because of these issues. I don't understand why npm is giving this issue is there any problem with my installation.

You probably don't have your node modules directory in your path. Does this work with npx?

npx create-react-app my-app

Thank you. Its working with npx

I used:
npm install -g create-react-app (in the client dir)>:
create-react-app .
